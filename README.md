# Yamone

_Yamone_ is a C++ background tool designed to interact with Eiger X-ray detectors. It retrieves TIFF data from the Eiger monitoring interface, processes the output, and shows the image using [ADXV](https://www.scripps.edu/tainer/arvai/adxv.html). The project utilizes several libraries to manage HTTP connections, read TIFF files, and handle network communications.

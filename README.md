# Yamone

_Yamone_ is a C++ application designed to interact with Eiger X-ray detectors. It retrieves TIFF data from the Eiger detector interface, processes the output, and shows the image using ADXV. The project utilizes several libraries to manage HTTP connections, read TIFF files, and handle network communications.
